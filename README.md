# Non-Invasive-Blood-Glucose-Monitor
Developing a Non-Invasive Blood Glucose Monitor using the TCRT1000 sensor to provide a painless, cost-effective, and real-time solution for monitoring blood glucose levels. This project combines optical sensing technology with signal processing algorithms to estimate glucose concentrations without the need for invasive methods.
