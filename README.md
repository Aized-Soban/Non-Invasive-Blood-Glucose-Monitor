# Non-Invasive Blood Glucose Monitor

## Project Description
This project focuses on developing a **Non-Invasive Blood Glucose Monitor** using the TCRT1000 sensor. The aim is to create a cost-effective, accurate, and user-friendly device that measures blood glucose levels without the need for painful finger pricks or invasive techniques. 

## Features
- **Non-invasive Monitoring:** Utilizes the TCRT1000 sensor to measure blood glucose levels optically.
- **Portable Design:** Compact and lightweight for easy handling and transport.
- **Real-Time Data:** Provides real-time measurements.
- **Cost-Effective Solution:** Designed to be affordable for widespread adoption.

## How It Works
The system leverages the **TCRT1000 infrared proximity sensor**, which detects changes in light reflectance caused by glucose concentrations in the blood. The collected data is processed using signal filtering and algorithms to estimate glucose levels accurately.

## Technology Stack
- **Hardware:**
  - TCRT1000 sensor
  - Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino/ESP32)
  - Supporting circuitry (e.g., resistors, capacitors, and amplifiers)
  
- **Software:**
  - Programming Language: C/C++
  - Data Analysis: Signal processing algorithms

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/non-invasive-glucose-monitor.git
   ```
2. Connect the hardware components as per the circuit diagram provided in the `docs` folder.
3. Upload the firmware to the microcontroller using the Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.
4. Power on the device and follow the instructions in the user interface.

## Usage Instructions
